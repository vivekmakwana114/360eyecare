            Eye exams have come a long way over the decades, and are very
            different from the ones your parents and grandparents might have
            had, though the core components are similar. In a city like Toronto,
            eye exams that are offered from office to office, optical to optical
            can vary a lot, from the very quick and basic to a more thorough
            exam much like going to your family physician for a yearly physical.

            optometrist will systematically go through several visual
            assessments and health screenings throughout the appointment. What
            you might consider a simple question or a basic action could tell
            the optometrist quite a lot about the physical condition of your
            eyes during the exam.

          As you can see, the eye exam has come a long way from the early days
          as technology has advanced, allowing doctors to assess and evaluate
          ocular conditions earlier than they had in the past. And with early
          detection comes early treatment and management. A thorough modern eye
          examination is just as important for your overall health as your
          yearly physical with your family doctor. It is important to note that
          not every eye examination offered will have all of these instruments
          and checks, so it is important to inquire ahead of time as to what the
          eye exam consists of and whether that is right for you and your needs.
