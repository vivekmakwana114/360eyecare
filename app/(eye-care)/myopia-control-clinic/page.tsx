          Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common vision condition where distant
          objects appear blurry. However, recent years have seen a troubling
          rise in myopia rates, particularly among children. This condition can
          not only impact a child's daily activities but also increase their
          risk of developing sight-threatening complications later in life.

          The good news is that early intervention can make a significant
          difference. Myopia Control Clinics offer specialized programs designed
          to slow or halt the progression of myopia in children. By addressing
          myopia early on, these programs aim to safeguard children's vision for
          the future.

              With myopia, however, the eyeball is either too long or the cornea
              is too curved. This shape throws off the focusing process, causing
              light rays to converge in front of the retina instead of directly
              on it. As a result, distant objects appear blurry, while close
              objects remain clear.
