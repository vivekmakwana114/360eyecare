          Dry eye, while treatable, is a condition many would rather avoid
          altogether. The good news is, there are steps you can take to keep
          your eyes lubricated and comfortable:

              <span className="font-bold">Proper Hydration:</span> Dry eyes
              crave hydration, so staying well-hydrated is important. Drink
              plenty of water throughout the day, even if you don't feel
              thirsty. Eight glasses a day is a good starting point, but you
              might need to adjust based on your climate and activity level.

              <span className="font-bold">Blink Exercises:</span> We blink
              naturally to spread tears across our eyes and keep them
              lubricated. However, staring at screens for extended periods can
              decrease our blink rate. Make a conscious effort to blink
              frequently, especially when using digital devices. You can also
              try the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from your
              screen for 20 seconds at something 20 feet away. This gives your
              eyes a chance to relax and rehydrate.

                  <span className="font-bold">Position your screen:</span> Your
                  computer screen should be slightly below eye level. This helps
                  prevent you from opening your eyes too wide, which can
                  accelerate tear evaporation.

                <div>
                  <span className="font-bold">Adjust the lighting:</span> Reduce
                  glare on your screen by adjusting the room lighting or using a
                  dimmer switch.

                  <span className="font-bold">Take breaks:</span> Get up and
                  move around every 30 minutes to an hour. Stretching your legs
                  and giving your eyes a break from the screen can help reduce
                  discomfort.
