    question: "How often should I get my eyes examined?",
    answer:
      "This depends on your age and previously diagnosed conditions, but a good rule of thumb is to have your eyes regularly checked every 1 to 2 years. The sooner we can spot potential vision issues developing, the easier it is to correct. Knowing when to visit an eye doctor to get your eyes checked is important. Not only is this information advisable, but it could also save you from potentially developing advanced eye conditions that might not have symptoms at early stages. Only your optometrist can determine how frequently you should be seen for an examination. However, the Canadian Association of Optometrists recommends the following as the minimum frequency for routine eye examinations: Infants and toddlers should undergo their first eye examination between the ages of 6 and 9 months. Preschool Children 2 to 5 years of age should undergo at least one eye examination in this period. Schoolchildren aged 6 to 19 years should undergo an eye examination annually. Adults aged 20 to 39 years should undergo an eye examination every 2 to 3 years. Adults aged 40 to 64 years should undergo an eye examination every 2 years. Adults aged 65 years or older should undergo an eye examination annually. The risk of developing ocular disease is higher at 65 years of age and older. Our doctors at 360 Eyecare in Toronto strongly advocate following the recommended frequency of visits to your optometrist. These exams will detect early signs of many age-related eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration.",

Also, if you currently wear glasses or contact lenses, please bring them with you. Lastly, if your exam requires your pupils to be dilated, we advise having someone else drive you.",
