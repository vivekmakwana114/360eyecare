    title: "Visual Acuity & The Snellen Chart",
    description:
      "The eye chart, officially known as the Snellen chart, is typically the first thing people think of when one says the phrase “eye exam”. The chart has several rows of letters of different sizes, with the largest letter on top and descending in size as you travel down the chart. Many patients recognize it for the big “E” at the top.",
    content:
      "The Snellen chart is used to measure visual acuity. Its creator, Dr. Herman Snellen, created the chart in the 1860s to help measure his patient’s visual ability when compared to what a “standard”, “healthy” or “emmetropic” eye can read from specific distances.",
    paragraph1:
      "The standard distance for acuity is six meters or 20 feet, and by adjusting the size of the letters on the chart, it can simulate what something would look like at further or closer distances. The patient is asked to read lines on the chart, and their ability to do so is compared to the results of the “standard” eye; when paired together, the result is the patient’s visual acuity.",
    paragraph2:
      "For example, if the smallest line a patient can read on the chart is the one designated as “20/40”, then that means that the patient must be 20 feet away to read what a “standard” eye can read clearly at 40 feet. This test is done with and without visual aid devices (glasses, contact lenses, etc.), and is used in conjunction with the phoropter to determine the refractive power required to get as close to 20/20 visual acuity as possible. Depending on a patient’s eyes, they may be able to achieve 20/20 acuity without visual aids, or with the use of visual aids.",
    title2: "What is Visual Acuity used for?",
    paragraph3:
      "Visual acuity is used as an indicator as to whether a patient may require glasses to legally drive – without glasses, a patient may only be able to achieve 20/80, but with glasses, they can comfortably achieve 20/20, for example. Visual acuity is also used to help diagnose and legally define low vision or blindness.",
    paragraph4:

      "One of the staple devices in the eye exam room, its design has had a few changes and modernizations as technology advanced. Also known as a refractor, the phoropter is typically mounted on an arm set up next to the exam chair that can swing and be manipulated in front of the patient’s eyes and face. The device contains many different lenses that can cycle in front of the patient’s eyes via manual or remote control. The optometrist can test and measure the patient’s refractive error by having the patient look through these lenses and evaluate how well they can see the eye chart at the other end of the room.",
    paragraph1:
      "The phoropter contains lenses that help measure spherical power, astigmatism power axis of rotation, and even prism power and direction. Older phoropters were controlled manually by the optometrist spinning specific dials while asking for subjective feedback from the patient as to the level of clarity of their vision with the current selection of lenses. Modern phoropters are controlled remotely with a separate control panel that can save multiple lens selections and combinations at once, allowing the optometrist to rapidly switch between lenses and hone in on the patient’s prescription. With the click of a button, the final readings can then be added to the patient’s chart and easily printed for – or even emailed to – the patient for their use.",

With the patient’s head positioned on the chin rest and against the forehead rest, the optometrist can look through the microscope and examine various points of interest from the front through to the back of the eye. The optometrist can examine the surface of the eye, the lids, and the meibomian glands along the lid margins, or the tear film and evaluate its effectiveness. ",
    paragraph1:
      "By manipulating the powerful light attached to the unit, the optometrist can bounce light inside the eye to see a cross-section of the layers of the cornea, and examine the anterior chamber and the lens between the anterior and posterior chambers. With stronger magnification, the optometrist can look further through an appropriately sized pupil (typically dilated) to see the back of the eye, where the retina, macula, and optic nerve head are.",
    paragraph2:
      "The slit lamp will typically have several smaller devices attached to it that can swing into position as needed. This may include a smaller bright light to aid in achieving a highly detailed view inside the eye or a tonometer to accurately measure the fluid pressure within the eye. While many devices and tools within healthcare have become digital and automatic, the slit lamp relies on the training and intricate manual control of the optometrist and remains one of the most useful tools of diagnostics in the optometrist’s arsenal.",

It is a machine with a computer on board that uses light and a digital camera to give a rough measurement of the surface of a patient’s eyes. This provides the doctor with a general reading of the high points and low points of the surface of the eye (known as the keratometry or k-readings) which is useful when determining the best fit for soft contact lenses. The auto-refractor can also give a rough estimate of the patient’s starting or neutral refractive error. While it only provides a rough estimate, it provides a useful starting point for the optometrist in the exam room to work with in determining an accurate refraction and prescription for the patient.",

    paragraph1:
      "Some auto-refractors are fitted with an additional device that uses a pin-point light to measure corneal thickness and ocular fluid pressure less invasively than older methods. The more memorable element of these auto-refractors is the “puff of air” that shoots out of the machine towards the patient’s eye. Sensors on the patient’s side of the machine then measure the pressure of the air that bounces back off the patient’s eye and calculate the internal pressure of the fluids. This method of testing is considered to be preferred as it does not involve touching the patient or the eye, and can be done without administering numbing drops.",

Known as fundus photography, the image captured can show the retina, macula, optic nerve, and all the veins and vessels all at once and in impeccable detail.",

    paragraph1:
      "While the slit lamp allows the optometrist to look at the same structures themselves, the photo is useful in seeing the whole of the rear of the eye as one image, and seeing the normally small parts of the eye at a much larger scale and level of detail only available with digital photography. Fundus photography can help detect retina or vitreous tears, damage caused by diabetic eye disease, swelling of the optic nerve, and early warning signs of glaucoma.",

Conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma can cause tissue damage within the layers of specialized cells that make up the retina. Still, that damage may not be visible on the uppermost layer. Age-related macular degeneration will cause the macula to become thinner over time, or cause abnormal blood vessels to grow and burst underneath the retina. So how can an optometrist look deeper within those retinal layers?",
    paragraph1:
      "The OCT, or optical coherence tomography, is another type of imaging test that uses waves of light to capture a cross-section scan of the retina and macula area in the back of the eye. This allows the optometrist to look for changes in retinal layer thickness or density or for any abnormal growths or separation within the layers. It is not an x-ray and does not need to touch the eye at all for these scans, it is more comparable to a quick ultrasound using light instead of sound to produce a clearer image.",

This test can detect any blind spots a patient might have or a decrease in peripheral ability over time due to conditions such as glaucoma",
    paragragph1:
      "The ways the visual fields test is administered can vary depending on whether the optometrist or ophthalmologist wants to run a basic check or a more in-depth examination. The detailed visual field test involves the patient looking into a machine called a perimeter and staring at a predetermined fixed point on the screen inside. The patient is then instructed to press a button every time they see a blinking light or moving line appear somewhere else on the screen without looking away from the center. The test is done per eye, with the untested eye covered for the duration, and can take anywhere from three to ten minutes to complete depending on the testing type.",

Certain jobs and careers require a visual field test as a part of their application process, and at least a basic visual field screening is required for new drivers getting their license in Ontario.

    question: "Can I wear contact lenses?",
    answer:
      "The answer depends on each patient. However, with today's technology and the advancements that have been made in this field, we can find solutions for many patients. Whether you have been diagnosed with astigmatism or presbyopia, you can correct the condition with both soft lenses or scleral contact lenses respectively. In other words, you may be a better candidate for contacts than you assume.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Are contacts uncomfortable?",
    answer:
      "This depends on your age and previously diagnosed conditions, but a good rule of thumb is to have your eyes regularly checked every 1 to 2 years. The doctor can inform you which conditions that require attention, or register if it is normal. Knowing when to visit an eye doctor to get your eyes checked is important. Not only is this information valuable, but it could also save you from potentially developing advanced eye conditions that might not have symptoms at early stages. Only your optometrist can determine how frequently you should be seen for eye examinations. Assume you were deemed a candidate and had a proper fit with no complications it typically only takes a brief period for you to adapt to the contacts and you won't notice any difference. The risk of developing ocular disease is higher at 65 years of age and older. Our doctors at 360 Eyecare in Toronto strongly advocate following the recommended frequency of visits by your optometrist. These exams will detect early signs of many eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Can they get lost behind my eyeball?",
    answer:
      "The conjunctiva (which is a thin membrane) covers the white of your eye and connects to your eyelid making it practically impossible for the contact lens to get lost behind the eyeball.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Can a contact lens be permanently stuck to my eye?",
    answer:
      "While it is true that the soft contact lens may stick to the surface of the eye when it (the lens) is dried out, re-moisturizing it should make it easy for you to remove it. A sterile saline solution or multi-purpose lens solution should be used to moisturize the lens.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Can contact lenses cause eye problems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, they can cause eye problems. Certain eye complications may arise due to the use of contacts. However, if you follow your optometrist's instructions regarding how to wear them, how to take care of them, how frequently they should be replaced, and how long to wear them then your risk of complications is reduced.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Can contacts pop out of my eyes?",
    answer:
      "Some years ago, the old-fashioned contacts would pop out of the eye during sports or any other rigorous activity. However, while it is still possible, recent advancements in both soft and rigid gas-permeable lenses have allowed for more customizable fits making it more difficult to dislodge.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Are contacts too expensive?",
    answer:
      "That depends on the brand and quality of lenses, but for the most part, contact lens prices have come a long way and most are quite affordable now. You can get disposable daily contacts (once considered a luxury) for less than the cost of a daily cup of coffee.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Am I too old to wear contacts?",
    answer:
      "Thanks to the bifocal contact lens, age is no longer a barrier. Our optometrists and opticians at 360 Eyecare are licensed and experienced in all modalities of contacts including multi-focal and mono-vision systems.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Do contacts require a lot of care?",
    answer:
      "Not really. A multipurpose solution or hydrogen peroxide can be used to clean and disinfect most lenses daily. Better yet, you can opt for daily disposable contacts, which save you a lot of headaches, as they do not require any solution. These lenses are disposed of daily and new ones are worn every day.",
